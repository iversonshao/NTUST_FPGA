Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:  149
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of 126,800    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         32 out of  63,400    1%
    Number used as logic:                       32 out of  63,400    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              32
      Number using O5 output only:               0

    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    16 out of  15,850    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           32
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            32 out of      32  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      32    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      32    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 126,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xa7a100t' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 100.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
